# MoE — WhatsApp Bot

A simple WhatsApp bot built on [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) (multi-device, no browser required).

## 🖥️ The Dashboard

This bot serves its own web dashboard (`public/`) on the same port it binds
for hosting — open the app's URL in a browser (its Railway domain, or
`http://localhost:3000` when running locally) to see:

- Live status for **your own** paired number, plus deployment-wide totals
  (active accounts, total users across everyone)
- A **"Request Pairing Code"** box — type a WhatsApp number and its
  8-digit code appears right there on the page, no need to read server logs
- Contact links

Pairing never happens through an environment variable or the console —
whoever opens the dashboard pairs their own number from the browser.

## 👥 Multiple Accounts

**This dashboard is multi-account.** Anyone you send the link to can type
their own WhatsApp number and get their own independent copy of this bot —
own session, own group settings, own anti-delete cache. Pairing one number
never disconnects or affects any other paired number. Trying to re-pair a
number that's already connected just tells you it's already connected
(rather than erroring confusingly) — delete that one number's folder under
`sessions/` if you actually want to free up its slot.

Two honest limits worth knowing before you share the link widely:

- **Memory.** Every paired account keeps a real, live connection open —
  that costs RAM per account, not per message. `MAX_SESSIONS` (env var,
  default `5`) caps how many can be connected at once so the app doesn't
  crash from running out of memory; once full, new pairing attempts get a
  clear "try again later" message instead of taking down everyone already
  connected. Raise it gradually and watch your host's memory usage —
  there's no universal safe number, it depends on your plan.
- **WhatsApp's own rules.** Baileys is an unofficial client — WhatsApp can
  rate-limit or ban numbers (especially new ones) that send a lot of
  automated messages, more so when many such numbers connect from the same
  server. Normal personal/friend-group use is generally fine; this isn't a
  guarantee against enforcement action if usage grows a lot.

**Upgrading from an older single-account version of this bot?** If a
top-level `session/` folder exists from before and no `sessions/` folder
has anything in it yet, this version detects the paired number in it and
migrates it to `sessions/<that number>/` automatically on first boot — you
don't need to re-pair.

## ✨ Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.menu` / `.help` | Show the command list (with banner image) |
| `.ping` | Check bot speed |
| `.alive` | Check if the bot is online (uptime) |
| `.owner` | Get owner contact info |
| `.sticker` / `.s` | Turn an image or short video into a sticker (send as caption, or reply to media) |
| `.tiktok` / `.tt` | Download a TikTok video without watermark — `.tiktok <link>` |
| `.ig` | Download an Instagram photo/video/reel — `.ig <link>` |
| `.fb` | Download a public Facebook video — `.fb <link>` |
| `.play` / `.song` | Search & send a YouTube track as audio — `.play <song name>` |

**Group management (admin only — the owner, or a real group admin, can use these):**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.tagall` | Mention every member — `.tagall <message>` |
| `.hidetag` | Same as `.tagall`, but doesn't list names in the text |
| `.kick` | Remove a member — reply to them or `@mention` them |
| `.promote` | Make a member a group admin |
| `.demote` | Remove a member's admin rights |
| `.antilink` | Auto-delete WhatsApp group invite links from non-admins — `.antilink on` / `off` |
| `.welcome` | Auto welcome/goodbye messages on join/leave — `.welcome on` / `off` |

Group actions call the real WhatsApp group admin API, so **the bot's own account must be an admin in that group** for `.kick`/`.promote`/`.demote`/`.antilink` deletions to actually take effect — otherwise WhatsApp itself rejects the request.

**Fun:**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.8ball` | Ask a yes/no question — `.8ball <question>` |
| `.quote` | Get a random motivational quote |

**Settings (owner only):**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `.autoviewstatus` | Auto-view contacts' status updates — `.autoviewstatus on` / `off` |
| `.antidelete` | Recover "delete for everyone" messages — `.antidelete on` / `off` |

Both default to **on** (matching the old always-on behaviour) and are saved to `sessions/<number>/botSettings.json` — each paired account has its own copy, so a toggle survives a restart without affecting anyone else's bot.

**Two things worth knowing before you assume either one is "broken":**
- **Auto status view** only makes the bot mark a status as viewed. For that view to actually show up to the person who posted it, **your own WhatsApp must have Read Receipts turned on** (Settings → Privacy → Read Receipts). If you've turned that off for your account, no view — bot or manual — will ever appear to them; that's a WhatsApp privacy rule, not something the bot can work around.
- **Anti-delete** can only ever catch **"Delete for everyone."** A plain **"Delete for me"** never notifies anyone else's device — WhatsApp doesn't send any signal for it — so there is nothing for any bot to detect or recover in that case.

**Always-on features (no command needed):**
- **Auto Status React** — optional; off by default. Set `AUTO_STATUS_REACT=true` in your env to auto-react to statuses with an emoji (`AUTO_STATUS_EMOJI`, default 💚).

All toggles (`.antilink`, `.welcome`, `.autoviewstatus`, `.antidelete`) are saved under that account's own folder in `sessions/` (created automatically, already gitignored) so none of them reset when the bot restarts, and none of them leak between different paired numbers.

Commands are auto-loaded from the `commands/` folder — drop in a new file (see `commands/ping.js` as a simple template) to add more without touching `index.js`.

### A note on the downloader commands

`.tiktok`, `.ig`, `.fb`, and `.play` all depend on free third-party/unofficial services (TikTok/Instagram/Facebook change their sites often, and YouTube actively fights downloaders). They're implemented with commonly-used, currently-working approaches, but **any of them can break without warning** if the upstream site changes — that's true of every WhatsApp bot with these features, not just this one. If one stops working, check the console error and let me know — usually it just means the extraction method needs a small update.

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in a browser (anyone else on your network can too — each person types their own number):

1. Type your WhatsApp number (with country code, digits only, no `+`)
2. Click **"Request Pairing Code"** — the 8-digit code appears on the page
3. On your phone: **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
4. Enter the code

> ⚠️ A `sessions/<your number>/` folder is created after login — **never commit `sessions/` to GitHub or share it with anyone**. It's equivalent to your WhatsApp account password, one folder per paired number.

> 💡 `npm install` pulls in `sharp` and `ffmpeg-static` (used for stickers), which download prebuilt binaries — this makes install a bit slower but means no manual ffmpeg setup is needed on the host.

## ☁️ Deploy on KataBump (or any panel-based host)

Panel hosts like KataBump, Pterodactyl, or similar don't give the process a real interactive terminal. The bot **never prompts for input** for this reason. This bot is **pairing-code-only** (no QR code at all).

1. Upload the project files (or connect your GitHub repo: `https://github.com/Newhafsathy048`)
2. Start the server, then open the panel's assigned URL/port in a browser — that's the dashboard
3. Type your number and click **"Request Pairing Code"** on the page itself
4. Enter the code on your phone: **WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**

### Previously hit this error?
```
Error [ERR_USE_AFTER_CLOSE]: readline was closed
```
That happened because an older version asked for your number interactively (`readline.question`), which panel hosts don't support — the input stream gets closed before the prompt runs. This version removes that prompt entirely; pairing happens through the dashboard instead.

## ☁️ Deploy on Railway

`railway.json` and `Procfile` are already included:

1. Push the code to your own repo, or deploy directly with `railway up` from this folder (no GitHub required)
2. Deploy — Railway assigns a public domain under **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain** if one isn't already there
3. Open that domain in a browser — that's the dashboard
4. Type your WhatsApp number and click **"Request Pairing Code"**; the code appears on the page (no QR — pairing code only)

**Session persistence:** Railway's filesystem is ephemeral across redeploys — the `sessions/` folder can be wiped on a rebuild, which would mean everyone re-pairing. Add a **Volume** in Railway (Settings → Volumes) mounted at `/app/sessions` to keep every paired account connected across redeploys.
